### About Train, Validation and Test Sets in Machine Learning
Quote the base definitions from [Tarang Shah](https://towardsdatascience.com/train-validation-and-test-sets-72cb40cba9e7)

> **Training Dataset:** The sample of data used to fit the model.

> **Validation Dataset:** The sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training dataset while tuning model hyperparameters. 
> The evaluation becomes more biased as skill on the validation dataset is incorporated into the model configuration.

> ***Test Dataset***: The sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training dataset.
> The Test dataset provides the gold standard used to evaluate the model. 
> It is only used once a model is completely trained(using the train and validation sets)
