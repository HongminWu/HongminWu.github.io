date: 2017-09-12 00:00:00 +0300
description: Our developed introspection system is divided into the following modulars, i.e. **Task Representation, Multimodal Feature Engineering, Introspection Models Construction, Anomaly Detection, Anomaly Classification, Anomaly Recovery, Synthetic Multivariate Time Series Argumentation...**

## Task Representation
1. Finite State Machine + Dynamical Movement Primitives (Current Solution)

```
2. Automatically generate the manipulation graph by segmenting the demonstrations
  2.1 Skill library
  2.2 Skill sequencing (decision making)
```
## Multimodal Feature Engineering

## Introspection Models Construction
**note:** we should consider all the possible scienios for training a introspection model, espectically, in case of the classifier model.

## Anomaly Detection

## Anomaly Classification

## Anomaly Recovery
